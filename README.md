# SkillForge — AI-Driven Adaptive Learning and Exam Generator

SkillForge is an intelligent learning platform built around a powerful Adaptive Learning AI Model, which forms the core USP of the system. The platform continuously analyzes each student’s performance, learning patterns, speed, accuracy, and strengths/weaknesses to generate a personalized learning journey.

SkillForge combines adaptive learning, exam generation, mentor insights, guardian monitoring, and admin-level control to create a complete and scalable educational ecosystem.

## Adaptive Learning AI Model (USP of the Project)

The Adaptive Learning Engine is the central component of SkillForge. It uses machine learning principles to:

* Analyze student performance, accuracy, time spent, and response patterns
* Identify weak concepts, learning gaps, and areas needing revision
* Dynamically adjust difficulty levels for all assessments and study material
* Generate personalized quizzes, practice sets, and mock tests
* Recommend learning resources based on individual student needs
* Provide mentors with real-time insights for targeted guidance
* Track improvement trends and update the learning path continuously

This ensures that each student receives a unique learning experience tailored to their pace and skill level.
