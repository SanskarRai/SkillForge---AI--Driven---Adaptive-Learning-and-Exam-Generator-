## Detailed Milestones

### 1. Requirement Analysis

* Identification of all actors (Student, Guardian, Mentor, Admin)
* Mapping their responsibilities and interactions
* Defining the project's core objectives and functional scope

### 2. Use Case Diagram

* Completed use case representation for all actors
* Coverage of all primary interactions within the system

### 3. System Workflow

* End-to-end workflow showcasing user interactions
* AI decision-making steps integrated into the flow
* Mapping how requests move from frontend → backend → AI → result screen

### 4. System Architecture

* High-level architecture finalised
* Breakdown of frontend, backend, AI module, database, and cloud services
* Defined API layers and data flow

### 5. UI/UX Planning

* Basic wireframes drafted (student dashboard, mentor panel, admin interface)
* Initial layout and navigation structure confirmed

### 6. Documentation

* README prepared
* Actor-specific feature lists completed
* AI USP highlighted
* High-level modules and system overview documented
